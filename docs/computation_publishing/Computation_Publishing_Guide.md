# Computation Publishing Guide 
## Computation Guidelines  

1. **Explicit Input Format**  
   - Each computation has a single, explicitly defined input format.  
   - Data preparation does not occur within the computation itself.  

2. **Supporting Scripts**  
   - We provide scripts to convert existing data into the required format.  
   - We provide scripts to check dataset preparedness.  

3. **Approval Process**  
   - Vince gives the final seal of approval for computations.
