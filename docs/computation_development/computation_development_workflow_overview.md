### **Guide to Developing Computations for COINSTAC**

**Goal**: Create a well-designed computation that integrates seamlessly with the COINSTAC platform, works reliably, and produces meaningful results.

---

#### **Step 1: Develop a Working Prototype on Pooled Data**

- **Objective**: Ensure your analysis works correctly on centralized (pooled) data before moving to a federated context.

- **Actions**:
  - **Create a Script**: Write a script (e.g., in Python) that performs your analysis on a single, combined dataset.
  - **Validate Results**: Run the script to confirm it performs the analysis correctly and produces meaningful results.

- **Reasoning**:
  - This step confirms that your analysis logic is sound.
  - There is no point in moving forward if the analysis doesn't work on pooled data.

---

#### **Step 2: Conceptualize the Federated Workflow**

- **Objective**: Understand how your analysis would operate in a federated environment where data remains on local nodes (edge nodes), and only necessary information is shared with a central node.

- **Actions**:
  - **Identify Edge Node Computations**:
    - Determine what parts of the analysis can be performed locally on each dataset without sharing sensitive data.
  - **Define Central Node Computations**:
    - Decide how the central node will aggregate and process the information received from edge nodes.
  - **Collaborate**:
    - Work iteratively, possibly with the development team, to refine the federated approach.

- **Example**:
  - If calculating an average, each edge node computes its local average and count.
  - The central node collects these and computes the global average.

#### **Step 3: Prepare Deliverables for COINSTAC Integration**

Before integration with COINSTAC, provide two key deliverables:

1. **Description of the Federated Workflow**

   - **Purpose**: Clearly explain the sequence of steps that occur across the federated components (edge nodes and central node).

   - **Content**:
     - **Edge Node Steps**:
       - Detail the computations performed locally.
       - Specify what data is sent to the central node.
     - **Central Node Steps**:
       - Describe how it processes the aggregated data.
       - Outline how final results are derived.

   - **Format**:
     - Use diagrams, flowcharts, or bullet points for clarity.

   - **Example**:
     - **Edge Nodes**:
       1. Load local data.
       2. Compute local statistics (e.g., mean, variance).
       3. Send computed statistics to the central node.
     - **Central Node**:
       1. Receive statistics from all edge nodes.
       2. Aggregate the statistics.
       3. Output the final analysis result.

2. **Set of Functions with Explicit Input and Output Types**

   - **Purpose**: Provide clean, well-defined functions for both edge and central computations.

   - **Content**:
     - **Edge Node Functions**:
       - Functions that process local data and produce outputs to be shared.
     - **Central Node Functions**:
       - Functions that aggregate data from edge nodes and compute the final results.

   - **Specifications**:
     - **Explicit Types**:
       - Clearly define input and output types (e.g., integers, floats, dictionaries).
     - **Serializable Data**:
       - Ensure inputs and outputs are in formats that can be easily transmitted (e.g., JSON-serializable).

   - **Example**:

     - **Edge Node Function**:
       ```python
       def compute_local_stats(data: pd.DataFrame) -> Dict[str, float]:
           """
           Computes local statistics.

           Parameters:
               data (pd.DataFrame): The local dataset.

           Returns:
               Dict[str, float]: A dictionary containing computed statistics.
           """
           local_mean = data['value'].mean()
           local_count = len(data)
           return {'local_mean': local_mean, 'local_count': local_count}
       ```

     - **Central Node Function**:
       ```python
       def aggregate_global_stats(local_stats: List[Dict[str, float]]) -> float:
           """
           Aggregates statistics from edge nodes to compute the global result.

           Parameters:
               local_stats (List[Dict[str, float]]): A list of statistics from edge nodes.

           Returns:
               float: The global computed statistic.
           """
           total_sum = sum(stat['local_mean'] * stat['local_count'] for stat in local_stats)
           total_count = sum(stat['local_count'] for stat in local_stats)
           global_mean = total_sum / total_count
           return global_mean
       ```

### **Final Notes**

- **Review and Testing**:
  - Test your functions with sample data to ensure they work as expected.
  - Verify that data types and structures are consistent and correctly defined.

- **Documentation**:
  - Provide comments and docstrings in your code for clarity.
  - Include any assumptions or prerequisites in your workflow description.

- **Collaboration**:
  - Share your deliverables with the COINSTAC development team.
  - Be open to feedback and ready to refine your computations as needed.

### **Summary**

By following these steps and preparing the specified deliverables, you set a solid foundation for integrating your computation with COINSTAC:

1. **Working Prototype**: Validate your analysis on pooled data to ensure correctness.
2. **Conceptual Federated Workflow**: Plan how your analysis will function in a federated environment.
3. **Deliverables**:
   - **Workflow Description**: A clear outline of the federated computation steps.
   - **Functions with Explicit Types**: Clean code for edge and central computations with defined inputs and outputs.

This structured approach helps focus your efforts, validates the fundamental elements of your computation, and facilitates collaboration with the development team. It ensures that the final integrated computation is reliable and produces meaningful results.

---

**Remember**: The key is to start with a solid foundation (working pooled data analysis) and then thoughtfully adapt it for the federated context, clearly documenting each step along the way.
