## Purpose

This repository serves as the **central resource** for:

- **Technical documentation** on the COINSTAC Computation Interface.
- **Publishing requirements** for computations.
- **Guides, references, and best practices** for developing, validating, and publishing computations on COINSTAC.
- A **boilerplate application** to demonstrate basic functionality and provide a starting point for computation development.

## Boilerplate Application

Included in this repository:

- A demonstration of basic COINSTAC computation functionality.
- A workflow for developing and testing computations.
- A foundation for new computation projects.

### Quick Start

To quickly get up and running with the boilerplate application, refer to the [Quick Start Guide](quick-start-guide.md).
